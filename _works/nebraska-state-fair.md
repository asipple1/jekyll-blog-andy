title: Nebraska State fair
description: >-
  Website for Nebraska State fair built from the ground up. My role was the lead
  developer with one backend developer and one front-end developer. My team and
  I used pattern lab to help us split up components into atoms, molecules, and
  organisms. My responsibilities were to handle backend and frontend and to
  divide up the task between teammates. Help the frontend developer where needed
  and vice-versa backend. Assisted the producers in training documentation on
  how to use the CMS for handoff to the client.
